# Astronaut Application

This is an HTML form for NASA's astronaut application. It allows users to input their personal and physical details, as well as their desired mission.
**HTML Elements Used**

The form is structured using HTML5 elements such as header, nav, main, section, article, label, input, select, option, and textarea. The metadata section includes meta elements for character encoding, compatibility settings, description, viewport, author, and title. The form also includes link and script elements for linking to external stylesheets and scripts.

**Styling and Scripting**

The form is styled using an external CSS stylesheet located in the "style" folder. It uses grid layout for the form's layout and responsive design. The form also includes a script located in the "javascript" folder. The script validates the form data, ensuring that all required fields are filled out and that data is in the correct format. When the form is submitted, it sends the data to a third-party API using the HTTP POST method.
