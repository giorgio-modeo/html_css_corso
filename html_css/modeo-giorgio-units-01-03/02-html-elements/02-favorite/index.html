                        The term generally refers to software, but in some cases, it can also refer to a dedicated hardware device for a specific game.
                        In Italian, the anglicism <b>videogame</b> is sometimes used, although the correct English term is <b>video game</b>.
                        [3] The person who plays a <b>video game</b> is called a <b>video gamer</b> or a gamer and uses one or more input devices called controllers, such as a gamepad, joystick, mouse, or keyboard.  <!-- This describes the terminology and equipment associated with video games -->

                            In 1952, A.S. Douglas, as an example for his doctoral thesis, created OXO, a computerized version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe in the laboratories of the University of Cambridge. This is usually considered the first video game from a technical standpoint, as it used a cathode ray tube for display[5]. However, its purpose was not to entertain users but to complete Douglas's thesis. In 1958, physicist Willy Higinbotham of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, noticing the little interest that students had in the subject, created a game called Tennis for Two, which aimed to simulate the physical laws that could be observed in a game of tennis. The means used was an oscilloscope. This is remembered more as a university experiment than a game. <!-- This describes the history and origin of video games -->
