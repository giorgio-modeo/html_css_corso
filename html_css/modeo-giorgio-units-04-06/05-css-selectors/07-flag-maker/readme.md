This CSS file contains styling rules for different flag designs.
The rules are applied to a table element and its child elements (i.e., table cells or td).

The first rule sets the margin to 1% on the top and bottom and centers the table horizontally on the page.
The second rule specifies that the borders between table cells should collapse, giving a uniform appearance to the table.

The next set of rules defines the colors for the Italian flag.
The first rule applies a green background color to all table cells in every row.
The second rule applies a white background color to every fourth cell, starting from the fourth cell.
The third rule applies a red background color to every seventh cell, starting from the seventh cell.

These CSS rules define a table with a class "rom" that changes the background color of its cells when you hover over it.
The first rule applies a dark blue background color to all table cells in every row when the mouse hovers over the table.
The second rule applies a yellow background color to every fourth cell, starting from the fourth cell, when the mouse hovers over the table.
The third rule applies a dark red background color to every seventh cell, starting from the seventh cell, when the mouse hovers over the table.

The next set of rules defines the colors for the United States flag.
The first rule applies a blue background color to the first four cells of each row.
The second rule removes the border from all cells in the table. The third rule sets a red background color for every odd row.
The third rule sets the position of the element to absolute, displays a white asterisk symbol, sets the font size to xx-large, and aligns the element to the top of the cell.

The rules for the flags of France, Ireland, Belgium, Nigeria, Germany, Fillan, England, Armenia, Austria, Bolivia, and Bulgaria follow a similar pattern of defining the background color for specific cells or rows in the table. Some flags have additional rules to style specific cells or rows differently.
