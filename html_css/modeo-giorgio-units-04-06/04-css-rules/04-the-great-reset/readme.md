*the differences*

DeStyle is a minimalist CSS library that provides a baseline for removing default styles without adding any new ones. It only removes styles that are considered harmful, such as margins and padding, leaving everything else intact.

Normalize is a CSS library that aims to make default styles consistent across different browsers. It achieves this by providing a set of styles that normalize the default styles of HTML elements across all browsers, such as setting the font size of headings to the same value.

Reset is a CSS library that completely resets the default styles of HTML elements to a blank slate. This means that all styles are removed, including margin and padding, and developers have to define all styles from scratch.

In summary, DeStyle removes harmful default styles, Normalize makes default styles consistent across browsers, and Reset completely resets all default styles to a blank slate.
