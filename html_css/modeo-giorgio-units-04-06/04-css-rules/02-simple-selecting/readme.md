**Description**
This is a simple HTML document that contains basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and tables. It is designed to display a page with a title, some sections, and articles within those sections.

**HTML Structure**
The HTML document is divided into two main sections: <head> and <body>. The <head> section contains meta information about the document, such as the title and character encoding. It also links to an external CSS file located at "style/main.css". The <body> section contains the visible content of the document.
Within the <body> section, there are two <section> elements. Each <section> contains one or more <article> elements
